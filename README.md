# BulkAssignmentsShift
A tool for Sakai to update Assignment dates in bulk.  Really basic.  Built with Electron.

To build project:

1. Install NodeJS and NPM if needed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Clone this git repository
3. Go to the cloned directory in your shell and run these commands
3. "npm install"
4. "npm run dist"

The executable/installer will be placed in the "dist" folder.

# Warning
You're welcome to look at the code, but it may damage your sanity.  This thing was built on the bones of a few other half-done experiments.  I stopped working on it as soon as it basically worked. It's full of partially-finished features.  (But it could still save you a ton of time.)
