# BulkAssignmentsShift
A tool for Sakai to update Assignment dates in bulk.  Really basic.  Built with Electron.

To build project:

1. Install NodeJS and NPM if needed
2. Clone this
3. "npm install"
4. "npm run dist"

The executable/installer will be placed in the "dist" folder.

# Warning
You're welcome to look at the code, but it may damage your sanity.  This thing was built on the bones of a few other half-done experiments.  I stopped working on it as soon as it basically worked. See:
